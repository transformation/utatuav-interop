Interoperability Integration
============================

This section describes how to integrate with the interoperability system. This
is provided as a resource for teams, not as a solution to the task. This is
provided as is, no further clarification will be given, and details should be
verified on your own before use. The intention is not to solve problems for the
teams, but to soften potential challenges that are not the focus of this task.

#. :doc:`example`.
   Example commands to interact with the server. This is for demo purposes
   only, it is not an implementation with sufficient performance, reliability,
   or robustness.
#. :doc:`client`.
   Client libraries that can be used to integrate with the interoperability
   system.
#. :doc:`mission_planner`.
   A complete solution for UAS Telemetry interoperability for autopilots which
   use APM Mission Planner.
#. :doc:`hints`.
   Hints for implementing interoperability. Common performance problems are
   addressed here.
