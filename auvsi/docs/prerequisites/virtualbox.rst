VirtualBox
==========

VirtualBox is a software system for running virtual machines. Virtual
machines allow a user to run a different operating system on top of a
different host operating system. VirtualBox is not necessary to deploy
the AUVSI SUAS competition server as teams can use a dedicated machine,
or deploy to their own base systems (with no support).

Teams intending to use VirtualBox should do the following:

#. `Visit the Virtual Box Page <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`__
#. `Download and Install Virtual
   Box <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`__
#. `Read the User
   Manual <https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html>`__
#. `Complete a
   Tutorial <http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox>`__
