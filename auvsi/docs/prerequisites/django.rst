Django Web Server
=================

Django is a web framework and server written in Python. The AUVSI SUAS
competition server is built on top of Django. Django is the main
dependency of the competition system. Django comes with many features
like:

#. **Object Relational Mapper (ORM)**. Define objects in code and the
   system will automatically generate appropriate database tables and
   generate the create/read/update/delete code. This makes developing
   durable systems much easier and simpler.
#. **Admin Interface**. Django comes with an automatically generated
   administration interface that can be used to manage stored objects,
   manage users, and much more.
#. **URL to Handler Mapping**. Users can define simple
   regular-expression based mappings from URLs to request handlers.
   These mappings can be also be chained for modularity.
#. **Template System**. Django has a Model-View-Controller design
   pattern. Part of this is a template system used to generate views
   based on response context. The template system makes it easy to
   separate the control logic from the view.
#. **Cache System**. High performance systems require caching to save on
   expensive database or calculation requests.
#. **Much More**. Internationalization, user authentication, system
   migrations, security, forms, web application tools, etc.
