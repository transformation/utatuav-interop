Puppet
======

Puppet is an IT automation system which can be used to automatically
install system dependencies, automate system setup and configuration,
and even automate building and deployment of software. The AUVSI SUAS
competition system uses Puppet to track dependencies and automatically
set them up. Teams can install dependencies manually, but the
competition recommends using Puppet.
