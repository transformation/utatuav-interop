Git
===

Git is a distributed version control system. Version control systems
assist in tracking changes between files, managing revisions,
coordinating between teams, and distributing software source. The AUVSI
SUAS Competition system is hosted on Github using the Git system. Teams
can either use Git to download (clone) the repository, or teams can
download a ZIP file containing the source code using Github. Teams
should use Git to download the repository because they can synchronize
with updates using simple commands, rather than downloading a new ZIP
file and replacing the old contents. Teams should also look into using
Git or SVN for their own systems.

Teams intending to use Git should do the following:

#. `Visit the Git SCM Website <http://git-scm.com/>`__
#. `Download the Git Program & GUI <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`__
#. `Read & Complete the Github Git
